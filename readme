This is an initial draft of what will become a R package (eventually) which implements the method described in J. Martin Bland & Douglas G. Altman (2007) Agreement Between Methods of Measurement with Multiple Observations Per Individual, Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics, 17:4, 571-582, DOI: 10.1080/10543400701329422

The data from the paper is contained in the csv file.  The ba_example.r file calls ba_functions.r and outputs the analysis and figures as shown in the paper. 

With thanks to Bland and Altman, for writing a methods paper that even I could follow.
